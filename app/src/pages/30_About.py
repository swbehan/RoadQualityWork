    Despite the vast amount of public data on tourism and road infrastructure within the E.U., 
    there is no unified platform that transforms this information into a meaningful guidance tool 
    for a diverse range of users. 
    - Casual road trippers often struggle to plan efficient/affordable 
    trips due to overly technical datasets on road quality, traffic, and travel costs. 
    - Meanwhile, national officials tasked with promoting tourism and improving infrastructure lack accessible 
    tools to benchmark their country’s performance, predict tourism trends, or assess the effectiveness 
    of public investment in transportation. 
    - Academic researchers face yet another barrier: while they 
    need historical and comparative data for modeling and publication, much of the available information 
    is fragmented or lacks interoperability.
